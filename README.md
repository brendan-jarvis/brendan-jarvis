ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m currently working on Production Support for an ASP.NET MVC Framework 4.5 and Microsoft Azure Power Apps applications.

I am a full-stack JavaScript and ASP.NET web developer with a unique background in law and chemistry. Skilled in JavaScript, React, PL/SQL, and ASP.NET.

A notable personal project of mine is ['Whisper Subtitles'](https://github.com/brendan-jarvis/whisper_subtitles), a Python script that scans a directory then uses OpenAI Whisper library to generate .srt files with subtitles for compatible audio and video files.

Check out my current page at http://svelte-brendan-jarvis.vercel.app/ for more information on my work!
